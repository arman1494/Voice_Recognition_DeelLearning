# Voice_Recognition_DeelLearning

This is a voice recognition based on DeepLearning. First of all, the model is being trained with a data set that can be download from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge) after for testing an adaptive white gaussian noise is being generated and added to the audio signals. After that, for testing in more details, this code conatins speech-recognition API of google, Edit distance and phonetic similarity test. After that this model would be connected to a chat-bot based on RASA to do simple switch of turning on and off lamps.

This model has been trained in 50 epochs that the result has been uploaded with the code.
